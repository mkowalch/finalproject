<h2>Visual Narrative for Mobile Data</h2>

<p>
This website shows some data I collected on myself using the Aware Framework App found <a href="http://www.awareframework.com">here</a>.  What follows is a discussion of the data's quality and some visualizations of the data as well as a simple question that the data can be used to answer.
</p>

<h2>Data Quality</h2>
<h3>Data Completeness</h3>
<p>
The data is far from complete.  I wanted to avoid using google cloud since I did not want to give my credit card and address to google, so I spent too much time trying to get the Aware website to connect to my own database.  I tried sqlite at first and even installed and setup a mysql database.  However, it never worked.  I also mistakely assumed that having the app installed and running with all sensors turned on would allow it to collect data.  This was wrong.  It only starts collecting once it is hooked into google.  Lastly, the sensors on my phone do not have the granularity that I expected.  I was anticipating creating a google map showing roads that I traveled on as well as a bit of biking that I did.  Instead, I only got a handful of unique points.  If I collected correctly over the 2-3 weeks that I had the app running, then perhaps I could have collected enough points to make a nice map.
</p>


<h3>Data Coherence</h3>
<p>
The data that I do have is coherent.  It is not obvious solely from the data, but using my own memory of travel and conversations that I had with people I can see how the data matches up with those events.  I do not understand how the units work in the Accelerometer data.  I read the documentation on the Aware website, but they say my phone should read 9 m^2 / second when the phone is at rest.  However, it appears to show some sort of change in acceleration from a default value.  In any case I do not need to know the exact unit values to detect my road travel vs my time at home or walking so at least in that regard the data does capture these events.  However, without my "expert" view of my own experiences this data would be difficult to understand without a better understanding of the unit values.
</p>


<h3>Data Correctness</h3>
<p>
I did not have to do any kind of "clean up" at all.  There were no missing values aside from some columns being empty as well as some tables being empty.  In the case of the columns, I was not interested in these at all, and the empty tables were a result of my phone lacking the necessary sensors.  There were no instances of incorrect values for categorical data.  All expected values were there.
</p>

<h3>Data Accountability</h3>
<p>
I cannot be certain of things like network rate or the accelerometer due to confusion over unit values and nothing else to compare it with.  I would need another phone using the same sensors to make a good comparison.  However, as I mentioned above, my own experiences match up with what I see in the data, so I am going to assume it is correct.
</p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<p>
What is my most active hour across all measures?  What hour produces the most speed, messages, locations, screen touches, etc?
</p>


<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<p>
The "Acceleration over Time" chart can be used to get an idea of when I was traveling in a car.  The x axis shows the count of hours since recording began, which was 2pm on October 17th, 2018.  Click on each "hour" bar to see the "Location Map" below filter by that hour.  Some hours have no locations so keep clicking different bars.
</p>
<p>
The "Location Map" shows my locations over this same timeperiod.  You can click on the barchart to see the locations I was in for each hour.  The locations are sparse due to the poor quality of my phone's location sensor.  I know I was in more locations than this, but it only captured a small number of unique points.  Looking at the map you can see the route that I take to go between my home and CMU.

<p>
The next chart group shows the screen "unlocked" state broken out by hour as well as the distribution of screen states.  I could not figure out how to do multi-barcharts correctly in Tableau so I created this chart elsewhere.  Note that screen state 0 means off, screen state 1 means on, screen state 2 means locked, and screen state 3 means unlocked.
</p>

<br>
<p>
As can be seen from the screen and acceleration visualizations, I generally do not use my phone while driving.  The multi-barchart tracks the "Unlocked Screen" chart above closely.  This is because I almost never interact with my phone unless its unlocked.
</p>

<p>
To answer the question it appears that hours 5, 20, and 26 are peak times for me with hour 5 being the winner.  They correspond to 7pm, 10pm, and 4pm, respectively.  This makes sense since I use my smartphone to interact with my wife after work.  I planned on showing a messages visualization, but it only has two users, my wife, and the parent of my daughter's friend who recently invited us to a birthday party.
</p>

<p>
The messages chart shows that I had two text message conversations.  One with my wife and the other with a parent of my daughter's friend who invited us to a birthday party.  This is not unusual for me.  I hardly ever text unless somebody contacts me.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I am not a big smartphone user so my data is very sparse.  Also, my phone sensors are not recording as well as they could, particularly the location sensor.  Attempting to work around google's cloud service was a mistake, which probably cost me weeks of data that could have given me some better visualizations.  Tableau is a good tool, but the Data Connector panel is tedious to use to look at different datasets at the same time.  One thing I am not sure of is why my google cloud dashboard says that the Aware app has uploaded hundreds of megabytes of data into the google cloud database, but when I dump every table to tsv files I only end up with 31MB of data.  I think I might be making a mistake somewhere with my sql.  In the end, I was able to use this data to confirm what I already know, that I use my smartphone after work to coordinate with my wife any plans we have for the evening.
